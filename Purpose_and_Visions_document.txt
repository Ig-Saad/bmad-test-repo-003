 Web UI for BMAD-Driven SDLC Platform - Requirements Write-up

   Executive Summary

   The proposed Web UI is a comprehensive platform that bridges the gap between upstream stakeholders (product
   managers, analysts, architects) and downstream development teams by implementing the BMAD (Business
   Methodology for Agile Development) framework in a web-based environment. This platform aims to democratize
   access to spec-driven development workflows for non-technical stakeholders while maintaining seamless
   integration with developer tools.

   Core Problem Statement

   Currently, there exists a significant disconnect between upstream stakeholders who create requirements using
   traditional tools (Word documents, SharePoint, PowerPoint) and downstream developers who work in IDEs with
   coding agents like GitHub Copilot. The BMAD framework provides excellent workflows for spec-driven
   development but is primarily accessible through VS Code, which creates barriers for non-technical users.

   Platform Vision

   Primary Objectives
     1. Democratize BMAD Workflows: Make BMAD methodology accessible to non-technical stakeholders through an
        intuitive web interface
     2. Bridge Upstream-Downstream Gap: Create seamless artifact synchronization between business stakeholders and
        development teams
     3. Enable Collaborative Development: Support multi-stakeholder collaboration throughout the entire SDLC
     4. Maintain Spec-Driven Approach: Preserve the integrity of specification-driven development practices

   Target User Personas
     • Primary Users: Product managers, business analysts, architects, UX designers, GTM teams
     • Secondary Users: Developers who prefer web-based interfaces for upstream activities
     • Administrative Users: Project administrators managing integrations and configurations

   Key Features and Capabilities

   1. Agent Orchestration System
     • Dynamic Role Switching: Implement BMAD's agent role switching (orchestrator → scrum master → architect)
       within the web platform
     • Prompt Management: Dynamic loading of role-specific prompts and workflows based on project context
     • Workflow Execution: Support for complex multi-step BMAD workflows through web interface

   2. Project and Workspace Management
     • Project Initialization: Template-based project setup with domain-specific configurations (Greenfield,
       Brownfield, Gaming, etc.)
     • Spec Registry: Centralized repository of specification templates and configuration files
     • Configuration Registry: Management of agent definitions, workflows, and task templates
     • State Management: Persistent storage of work-in-progress artifacts with session recovery

   3. Document and Artifact Management
     • Artifact Generation: Web-based creation of PRDs, MRDs, BRDs, and other specification documents
     • Version Control: Track changes and maintain document history
     • Template Library: Purpose-built specification templates for different project types and domains
     • Rich Text Editing: Enhanced document editing capabilities beyond basic markdown

   4. Integration and Synchronization
     • Repository Integration: Seamless sync with GitHub for both code and documentation
     • Collaboration Tools: Integration with Confluence, SharePoint, Teams for document storage
     • Third-party Tools: MCP server integrations for Figma, Mural, and other design tools
     • Enterprise Systems: Connectivity with Jira, Azure DevOps for project management

   5. Collaboration Workflows
     • Review and Approval: Built-in workflows for document review and stakeholder approval
     • Real-time Collaboration: Multi-user editing and commenting capabilities
     • Notification System: Automated alerts for workflow transitions and document updates
     • Communication Integration: Email and Teams integration for stakeholder notifications

   6. User Experience Enhancements
     • Intuitive Interface: Non-technical user-friendly design abstracting away technical complexities
     • Visual Artifacts: Enhanced rendering of architecture diagrams, flowcharts, and specifications
     • One-click Actions: Simplified operations like "Save to GitHub" or "Sync with Confluence"
     • Progress Tracking: Visual indicators for workflow progress and document synchronization status

   Technical Architecture Considerations

   Backend Requirements
     • Agent Implementation: Code-based implementation of BMAD agent orchestration logic
     • Workflow Engine: Support for dynamic workflow execution and role transitions
     • Integration Layer: APIs and connectors for third-party tool integration
     • Authentication & Authorization: RBAC system for multi-tenant access control
     • State Management: Persistent storage for work-in-progress and session data

   Key Technical Challenges
     1. Agent Orchestration: Implementing BMAD's dynamic role switching in a web environment
     2. Prompt Management: Efficient loading and execution of large, context-aware prompts
     3. State Synchronization: Managing document state between web platform and external repositories
     4. Integration Complexity: Supporting multiple enterprise tool integrations simultaneously

   Business Value Proposition

   For Non-Technical Stakeholders
     • Accessibility: Use BMAD workflows without learning VS Code or command-line tools
     • Familiar Interface: Web-based experience similar to other business applications
     • Enhanced Collaboration: Built-in review, approval, and communication workflows
     • Visual Enhancement: Better rendering of documents and diagrams compared to IDE

   For Development Teams
     • Seamless Integration: Automatic synchronization with existing development workflows
     • Improved Specifications: Higher quality, AI-generated specifications from upstream teams
     • Reduced Context Switching: Access to upstream artifacts without leaving development environment
     • Enhanced Traceability: Clear linkage between business requirements and implementation

   For Organizations
     • Complete SDLC Coverage: End-to-end support from ideation to deployment
     • Improved Productivity: Streamlined workflows and reduced manual handoffs
     • Better Alignment: Stronger connection between business objectives and technical implementation
     • Scalable Collaboration: Support for large, distributed teams across different tools

   Implementation Approach

   Phase 1: MVP Development
     • Core agent orchestration with web bundle prompts
     • Basic document creation and editing capabilities
     • GitHub integration for artifact synchronization
     • Simple project workspace management

   Phase 2: Enhanced Collaboration
     • Advanced integration with Confluence, SharePoint, Teams
     • Multi-user collaboration features
