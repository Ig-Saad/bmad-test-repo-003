# Project Brief: BMad v6-Powered SDLC Platform Web UI

## Executive Summary

The BMad v6-Powered SDLC Platform Web UI is a comprehensive web-based platform that democratizes BMad-CORE's proven AI-driven agile workflows for non-technical stakeholders while enabling complete project lifecycle orchestration using BMad Method v6. The platform addresses the fundamental disconnect where product managers, analysts, and architects create requirements using traditional tools (Word, SharePoint, PowerPoint, Figma) while developers work in IDEs with BMad v6's 12 specialized agents and scale-adaptive intelligence. By implementing BMad-CORE's **C**ollaboration **O**ptimized **R**eflection **E**ngine in an intuitive web interface with native support for business document formats, this platform enables non-technical users to leverage v6's 4-phase workflow structure (Analysis → Planning → Solutioning → Implementation) and 3-track scale-adaptive intelligence (Quick Flow, BMad Method, Brownfield) - generating the complete spectrum of SDLC and business artifacts while maintaining seamless integration with existing BMad v6 IDE workflows and the proven 12-agent orchestration system.

## Problem Statement

Currently, there exists a significant and costly disconnect between upstream stakeholders (product managers, business analysts, architects, UX designers, GTM teams) and downstream development teams in the software development lifecycle. Upstream teams create requirements and specifications using traditional business tools like Word documents, SharePoint, and PowerPoint, while downstream developers work in IDEs with advanced coding agents like GitHub Copilot and VS Code extensions. This creates multiple critical problems:

**The Gap:** BMad v6 provides revolutionary AI-driven agile workflows with 12 specialized agents, scale-adaptive intelligence, and proven 4-phase methodology, but it's primarily accessible through IDEs using markdown files, creating multiple barriers for non-technical users: (1) IDEs are "too technical" (as evidenced in GTM team feedback), (2) markdown format is unfamiliar to business users who work natively in .doc/.docx, .xlsx, PDF, and design tools like Figma, and (3) v6's sophisticated agent orchestration and scale-adaptive workflows are inaccessible to stakeholders who need web-based interfaces. This forces upstream stakeholders to either avoid using BMad v6's proven methodologies or struggle with both unfamiliar technical interfaces and foreign document formats, missing the benefits of scale-adaptive intelligence and specialized agent expertise.

**Interface Disconnect:** Business stakeholders create specifications in Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, and Figma designs, while developers need markdown files and code-based artifacts. The lack of accessible document viewing and editing capabilities in web-based platforms creates manual conversion overhead, version control issues, and information loss during handoffs.

**Impact:** This disconnect results in specification quality issues, increased downstream rework, delayed time-to-market, and inefficient handoffs between business and technical teams. Organizations lose the transformative benefits of BMad v6's scale-adaptive intelligence, specialized agent expertise, and proven 4-phase methodology because both the sophisticated tooling and document formats aren't accessible to the people who need to orchestrate complete project delivery.

**Urgency:** With BMad v6's revolutionary AI-driven agile capabilities and the rise of AI-powered development tools, the productivity gap between well-specified projects using proven methodologies and poorly-specified projects is widening exponentially. Organizations need to democratize access to BMad v6's scale-adaptive workflows and specialized agent orchestration now to remain competitive in an AI-accelerated development landscape.
