# Project Brief: BMad v6-Powered SDLC Platform Web UI - POC Phase

## Executive Summary

**The BMad v6-Powered SDLC Platform Web UI POC** validates the core concept of an intelligent web-based IDE that democratizes BMad v6's proven AI-driven agile methodology for complete SDLC lifecycle management. This proof-of-concept demonstrates how non-technical stakeholders can leverage BMad v6's scale-adaptive intelligence and specialized agent orchestration through familiar web interfaces and document formats (.doc, .xlsx, PDF), while maintaining seamless integration with existing BMad v6 IDE workflows. The POC specifically validates the "SDLC IDE over Web" concept through a functional demonstration of the complete user journey from project ideation through planning phases, with GitHub and SharePoint integrations proving platform extensibility and document synchronization capabilities.

## Problem Statement

**The Gap in SDLC Tooling:** While BMad v6 provides revolutionary AI-driven agile workflows with scale-adaptive intelligence, 12 specialized agents, and proven 4-phase methodology, it's primarily accessible through IDEs using markdown files. This creates significant barriers for non-technical stakeholders who are critical to project success but find IDEs "too technical" and markdown format unfamiliar. These stakeholders work natively in business document formats (.doc/.docx, .xlsx, PDF, Figma) and need web-based interfaces for effective collaboration.

**Impact of the Disconnect:** This accessibility gap results in:
- **Specification Quality Issues:** Non-technical stakeholders avoid using proven BMad v6 methodologies, leading to incomplete or poorly structured requirements
- **Increased Downstream Rework:** Lack of access to BMad v6's scale-adaptive intelligence and specialized agent expertise results in 30-40% more development iterations
- **Delayed Time-to-Market:** Inefficient handoffs between business stakeholders and technical teams using different toolsets
- **Lost Methodology Benefits:** Organizations cannot leverage BMad v6's transformative capabilities across their complete project lifecycle

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:** Current project management tools lack BMad v6's sophisticated AI-driven methodology, scale-adaptive intelligence, and specialized agent orchestration. They offer generic workflows rather than the proven 4-phase structure and context-aware agent selection that makes BMad v6 revolutionary.

**Urgency:** With BMad v6's proven capabilities and the rise of AI-powered development, the productivity gap between well-orchestrated projects using BMad methodology and traditional approaches is widening exponentially. Organizations need immediate access to BMad v6's power through accessible interfaces to remain competitive.

## Proposed Solution

**SDLC IDE over Web - POC Implementation:** The proof-of-concept demonstrates a web-based IDE that brings BMad v6's complete methodology to non-technical stakeholders through familiar interfaces while maintaining full integration with existing BMad v6 IDE workflows. The POC validates the core concept through a functional demonstration of the complete SDLC workflow from project ideation through planning phases.

**Core POC Components:**

**1. Intelligent Agent Orchestration Engine:** Web-based implementation of BMad v6's context-aware agent selection, presenting only relevant agents (Analyst, PM, Architect, UX Expert, etc.) based on project context rather than overwhelming users with all 12 agents simultaneously.

**2. 4-Phase Methodology Demonstration:** Complete web-based execution of BMad v6's proven workflow structure:
- **Configuration:** Project setup with integration configuration
- **Ideation:** AI-assisted brainstorming, market research, competitive analysis
- **Product Definition:** PRD and technical architecture generation
- **Planning:** Epic, feature, and user story creation with story point estimation

**3. Document Generation & Management:** AI-powered creation of complete project artifacts with comprehensive viewing and editing capabilities, maintaining BMad v6 methodology integrity and enabling seamless synchronization with connected repositories.

**4. Strategic Integration Validation:** POC demonstrates platform extensibility through GitHub (code repository) and SharePoint (document management) integrations, proving bidirectional synchronization capabilities and workflow continuity.

**5. Ignis Platform Telemetry Integration:** Comprehensive telemetry capture and real-time data transmission to the main Ignis Platform for user behavior analytics, workflow performance monitoring, and platform optimization, validating seamless integration with the broader Ignis ecosystem.

**Key POC Differentiators:**
- **First SDLC IDE over Web:** Demonstrates bringing IDE-level power to web interfaces for complete project lifecycle management
- **BMad v6 Methodology Preservation:** Maintains proven framework integrity while democratizing access
- **Intelligent Simplicity:** Complex AI-driven capabilities presented through intuitive, context-aware interfaces
